            </div>
             <p class="list-group-item-text"> Sharing your Projectlive campaign on Facebook is one of the easiest ways to get word out about your campaign. To effectively share on Facebook, you must take into account when to share and what to say.<p>
              <div class="list-group" align="center"> <a class="list-group-item active">
              <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">When to share</h4>
              </a>
           
 it is important to share on Facebook at a ‘high traffic hour’; that is the time when most of your friends and family will be scrolling through their newsfeed. So consider when most of your friends are usually online – within what hours and make sure to share your campaign when they would most likely see it in their newsfeed. It could be early morning hours for those who visit their timeline in the morning before work; or evening after work hours when most people are home from work, relaxing and surfing their social media pages. Essentially, think about your Facebook habits as a model for your community. <p>
   <div class="list-group" align="center">
  <a class="list-group-item active">
              <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What to say</h4>
              </a>
 Each post should include a short message to your friends and family, followed by your Projectlive campaign link, and a request for them to donate to your cause and share your campaign with their own network. The following template may be of assistance: <p>
   <div class="list-group" align="center">
  <a class="list-group-item active">
              <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"> At the beginning of a Projectlive campaign</h4>
              </a>
“Hello dear friends and family, I’m excited to announce that I created a Projectlive crowdfunding campaign to help [reason for campaign]. Please read my story and donate to my Projectlive campaign here [your Projectlive campaign link]. Please do me the favour of sharing my link with your friends on your timeline too. Thank you.” 
              
          
           <div class="list-group" align="center">
  <a class="list-group-item active">
              <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"> At the middle of a Projectlive campaign</h4>
              </a>
“Thanks to everyone who has donated, we’ve raised [amount raised] in [number of days] days. I’m grateful for your generous donation; thank you to all who shared my campaign. I’m only [state amount] from my goal, so I kindly ask you to keep sharing my Projectlive campaign [your campaign link] on your network. Each share gets me closer to my goal; I’m counting on your support, thank you.”
              
            </a>
             <div class="list-group" align="center">
  <a class="list-group-item active">
              <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"> At the end of a Projectlive campaign</h4>
              </a>
"Hello friends and family, I’m sharing my Projectlive campaign again in hopes of reaching my goal of [state amount]. Even after [state number of shares] we still have [state amount] to go. If you haven’t donated yet, please do so at [your Projectlive campaing link], and please keep sharing my campaign. Thank you all so much."
              
            </a>
            </div>  
             <div class="list-group" align="center">
  <a class="list-group-item active">
              <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"> NOTE</h4>
              </a>
 You should endeavor to share your Projectlive campaign consistently on Facebook because consistency is essential to sharing, and one Facebook post will not be seen by your entire friend group. So choose a timeframe within which you would consistently share your campaign on Facebook; it could be every three or four days, depending on your choice. <p>
Besides the general Facebook posts, Facebook messages (direct messages) is another way to share your Projectlive campaign. These direct messages act as the ‘personal touch’ that is often lost in social media posts written for the masses. Therefore choose particular people and send direct messages to them about your crowdfunding campaign on Projectlive. <p>
Individual Facebook messages are a true way to show people how much your Projectlive campaign means to you, and how much you would appreciate their donation and support. The more individual messages you send out, the more success you’re likely to see.<p>
When sending direct messages on Facebook be as specific as possible, and remember to tell the person why your campaign is important to you; finally be sure to ask for a donation from the individual or at least ask him/her to share your campaign with their network.<p>
When sending a direct message it is important that you know your audience, and send the message when you know they are likely to be online and have time to actually go to your link and look at your Projectlive campaign. <p>
Next is follow up; it doesn’t matter that you have sent a message to a particular person, you could always send a follow-up message especially if you got no feedback the first time. Remind them of your campaign and how much their donation and support mean to you. Honesty and vulnerability are great elements to factor in; if your friends can tell that you are emotionally committed to your campaign cause, they will become committed too. <p> 
You could also employ a Facebook event to share your Projectlive campaign. Facebook selects posts to show to a specific audience, so creating an event and inviting close friends and family guarantees that they see your campaign and read your story. This also gives your friends the opportunity to share your campaign with their own friends and family by inviting them to your event. <p>
Your guest list to your event should ordinarily include everybody that you want to see your Projectlive campaign. Your guest list should consist of close family and friends, friends of friends, and acquaintances. Include the ‘why’ behind your campaign in your event and a summary of what you are raising money for. <p>
Sharing your campaign with people in as many different ways as possible is important to a successful Projectlive campaign because people easily forget to donate after seeing your campaign for the first time. So share often through various ways, and remember that people feel more included in events when they see your personal invitation; and they are more likely to donate when they feel you are personally reaching out to them because you need their support.<p>
After the period for a Facebook event has elapsed, you could create a Facebook group of your closest friends and family to keep the momentum of your campaign going and have your team behind you to help you achieve your fundraising goal.
