                                        		  <div align="center">SIX STEPS TO A SUCCESSFUL CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN
                                        		    <h4>1. Have a powerful, catchy and descriptive title.</h4>
                                                    <p>The title of your campaign is probably one of the first things a donor will see on your campaign page; therefore you should make it alluring enough to keep the donor interested. Consider the length of your title – it must not be too long, but on the other hand it should be more than a three-word statement. Lengthy titles may come off as dull and uninteresting, whereas too short title may sound ambiguous. Therefore you should choose a title that would adequately convey the message of your campaign in a perfect way. In addition, your title should be memorable; not that the donor must be able to memorize it, but it should be such that will easily stick in the mind of a reader. Use verbs in the words of your title, and make sure that the title makes a clear reference to the cause for which you are campaigning. Finally, your title should identify directly the name of the person or people involved, or use words like &lsquo;Me&rsquo;, &lsquo;My&rsquo;, &lsquo;Us&rsquo;.                                                    </p>
                                                    <h4>2. Use pictures to make your campaign look its best.</h4>
                                                    <p>Photos are appealing. The more lovely the photo, the more appeal it brings. A lot of people have photogenic memories, and so even if they forget the title of your campaign, they would remember an image associated with the title if that image left an impression on them. Therefore you&rsquo;d want to use pictures that would appeal to the emotion you intend to stir up in the people who visit your campaign page. Upload pictures that will sync with the cause you are campaigning for; use real pictures of people and places involved; use bright images and videos. Your photo/video is your shot at creating a powerful first impression, so avoid blurry or low-quality images.                                                    </p>
                                                    <h4>3. Share your campaign with your network on social media.</h4>
                                                    <p>Your first supporters would be the people in your life – who know you and believe in you. Therefore it is important that you start off sharing your campaign with your friends and family on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. This should be your first step after creating your campaign page; and when posting on social media, remember to add a personalized message with your link explaining why your Projectlive campaign means so much to you, and how you&rsquo;d really appreciate donations. You may even convince your friends to share your link among their own network to raise more support and donation for you.</p>
                                                    <p align="justify" style="color:#404040;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;font-weight:lighter;padding:0;margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
                                                    <h4>4. Engage in personal outreaches</h4>
                                                    <p>In addition to sharing your campaign on social media, you should make telephone calls, send emails, and text messages to create awareness for your Projectlive campaign. Ask in person when you get the opportunity because face to face is sometimes more effective than sending emails. Spread word about your campaign story on the social networks and communities you are part of or belong to. Doing all you can to build a strong sense of community around your crowdfunding campaign will go a long way towards ensuring a consistent donation volume.</p>
                                                    <p align="justify" style="color:#404040;font-size:16px;line-height:22px;font-weight:lighter;padding:0;margin:0">&nbsp;</p>
                                                    <h4>5. Post updates about the progress of your campaign frequently.</h4>
                                                    <p>This will keep donors and visitors to your page interested and encouraged particularly when they can see that you are indeed making progress. But you must be honest about your progress/status report. Posting frequent update is one way to continue engaging the people who want to help you most. You may share updates on how donations are being used; &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; shout outs to those who have donated or shared; and how close you are to your goal. You may include a call to action like: &ldquo;Thanks for reading. Please donate and spread the word to a few people you&rsquo;d like to share my story with&rdquo;.</p>
