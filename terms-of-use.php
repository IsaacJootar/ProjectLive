              Welcome to Projectlive. By using this website and our services, you’re agreeing to our Privacy Policy and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our rules for starting projects. These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and Projectlive with respect to our Services. They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Projectlive with respect to our Services and govern our future relationship. These Terms are personal to you. You can’t assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Projectlive’s prior written consent.
              <P>
               <h5>1.0 ACCOUNT CREATION</h5><p>
                Essentially, Projectlive is for your personal and non-commercial use.  
You can browse Projectlive without registering for an account, but to use some of Projectlive’s functions, you’ll need to register. To sign up for a Projectlive account, you need to be 18 or over. To create an account, you’ll need to choose an account name and set a password. The information you provide has to be accurate and complete. Don’t impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive or that violate anyone’s rights. 
You’re responsible for your account and all the activity on it, and especially for keeping your password confidential.  
<h5>2.0 CREATORS AND DONORS</h5><p>
  Projectlive only provides a funding platform for donation campaigns, creative projects, etc. When a creator (in this case, you) posts a project on Projectlive, they’re inviting other people to form a contract with them. 
Anyone who backs a project is accepting the creator’s offer, and forming that contract. <strong>Projectlive is not a part of this contract</strong> — the contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and their donors.  
Here are the terms that govern that agreement
 <ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> When a project or campaign is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward (if any). Once a creator has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their backers (donors).</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Throughout the process, creators owe their donors a high standard of honest communication and a dedication to fulfilling the campaign needs and promises. At the same time, donors must understand that when they back a project or campaign, they’re helping to bring it into fruition. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised.</li>. 

<li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by donors.</li>
 <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards(if any), they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for donors or post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned. They should also be able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised.</li> <p>
 <h5>3.0 FUNDING</h5><p>
  Responsibility for finishing a project lies entirely with the project creator. Projectlive doesn’t hold funds on creators’ behalf, in a way that may warrant ProjectLive to be held responsible, ProjectLive cannot guarantee creators’ work, and does not offer refunds-donations should be willingly.<p> 
These are the terms that apply when you’re creating a project: <p>
 <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> You can refund individual pledges if you want. You can cancel and refund a donor’s pledge at any time. If you do, you have no further obligation to that specific donor even if the campiagn you are running promised any obligations, in this case, no agreement exists between you and the donor.</li>
 <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Projectlive and its payment partners will subtract fees before funding your account.</li>
 <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> There may be a delay between the end of a successful campaign and your access to the funds. We demand 7 working days, thus, we advise that you take no action in reliance on collecting any of the money pledged until you actually have the ability to withdraw it from your account and spend it. </li><p>
  <h5>4.0 FEE</h5><p>
    Creating an account on Projectlive is free. If you create a project that is successfully ended, we (and our payment partners) collect fees. <p>
      <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Fees are only charged on successfully ended projects, and only when projects are ended. We charge 5% platform fee, in addition to any fees from our payments partners. However, we will not collect any fees without giving you a chance to review and accept them. If our fees ever change, we’ll announce that on our website. Some funds pledged by donors are collected by payment providers. Each payment provider is its own company, and Projectlive isn’t responsible for its performance.</li>
        <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> You’re also responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of Projectlive.</li><p>
          <h5>5.0 DAMAGES AND LOSSES</h5><p>\
            Projectlive isn’t liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the services. We don’t become involved in disputes between users, or between users and any third party relating to the use of our services. All content you access through the Services is at your own risk. You’re solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party. <p>
              <h5>6.0 OTHER WEBSITES </h5><p>
                Projectlive may contain links to other websites. (For instance, project pages, user profiles, and comments may link to other sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We don’t control or endorse those sites. 
Projectlive partners with other companies (such as PayStack, etc) for payment processing. When you fund or create a project, you’re also agreeing to the payment processor’s terms of service. <p>
 <h5> 7.0 YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY </h5><p>
  Projectlive doesn’t own content you submit to us (your “Content”). However, we do need certain licenses from you in order to perform our Services. When you submit a project for review, or launch a project, you agree to these terms: <p>
    <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> We can use the content you’ve submitted. You grant to us, and others acting on our behalf, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right to use, exercise, commercialize, and exploit the copyright, publicity, trademark, and database rights with respect to your Content.</li> 
<li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>When we use the content, we can make changes, like editing or translating it. You grant us the right to edit, modify, reformat, excerpt, delete, or translate any of your Content.</li> 
<li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Any royalties or licensing on your Content are your responsibility. You will pay all royalties and other amounts owed to any person or entity based on your Content, or on Projectlive’s hosting of that Content.</li>
 <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> You’re responsible for your content. All information submitted to the site, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom that content originated.</li>
 <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> We’re not responsible for mistakes in your content. Projectlive will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any content. </li><p>
 <h5> 8.0 PROJECTLIVE’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h5><p>
  Projectlive’s Services are legally protected in various ways, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other rights and laws.

If you want to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, or store any of this content for a commercial purpose, you need prior written permission from Projectlive or the relevant copyright holder. <p> 

<h5>9.0 ACCOUNT DELETION </h5><p>
  You can terminate your account at any time. All provisions of this agreement survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content you’ve already submitted to the site. However, if you’ve launched a project or campaign, deleting your account will remove the project from the site. <p>
   <h5> 10.0 OUR RIGHTS </h5><p>

    <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> We can cancel accounts or decline to offer our Services. </li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>We can change our eligibility criteria at any time.</li>
   <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>We have the right to cancel any pledge to any project, at any time and for any reason.</li>
   <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> We have the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend any project at any time and for any reason.</li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> Projectlive is not liable for any damages as a result of any of these actions, and it is our policy not to comment on the reasons for any such action. </li><p>
     <h5> 11.0 WARRANTY DISCLAIMER </h5><p>
      We work hard to provide you with great services, but we can’t guarantee everything will always work perfectly. This site is presented as-is, without warranties. You use our Services solely at your own risk. They are provided to you “as is” and “as available” and without warranty of any kind, express or implied. <p>
        <h5>12.0 INDEMNIFICATION</h5><p>
          If you do something on Projectlive that winds up getting us sued, you have to help defend us. 
If you do something that gets us sued, or break any of the promises you make in this agreement, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other legal costs) that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of Projectlive. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to this indemnification clause, in which case you agree that you’ll cooperate and help us in asserting any defenses. <p>
  <h5>13.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5><p>
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Projectlive, its directors, employees, partners, suppliers, or content providers be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, consequential, special, or exemplary damages of any kind, including but not limited to damages.<p>
    (i) resulting from your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Services;  
(ii) for any lost profits, data loss, or cost of procurement or substitute goods or services; or  
(iii) for any conduct of content of any third party on the Site. In no event shall Projectlive’s liability for direct damages be in excess of (in the aggregate) one hundred thousand naira (₦100,000.00)
<h5>14.0 DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND GOVERNING LAW </h5><p>
We at Projectlive encourage you to contact us if you’re having an issue, before resorting to the courts. In the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that Projectlive and its Services are deemed a passive website that does not give rise to jurisdiction over Projectlive or its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers, or shareholders, either specific or general, in any jurisdiction other than the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms, or your use or non-use of Projectlive, shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Nigeria, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. You hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to trial by jury in any dispute, action, or proceeding. <p>
<h5>CONCLUSION</h5><p> 
If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either you or Projectlive to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way won’t be deemed a waiver of any other rights. 
Projectlive has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent. Projectlive will provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site.<p>
